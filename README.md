# Odin Form Project

This project is my attempt at completing the [Odin Form Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

This is a relatively simple attempt to replicate a general website sign up / account creation page.

## Stack

There's nothing too fancy going on under the hood here:

- Vanilla Javascript
- CSS
- HTML5
